Description: 
    Provides delayed computation of a matrix of residuals after fitting a
    linear model to each column of an input matrix. Also supports partial
    computation of residuals where selected factors are to be preserved in the
    output matrix. Implements a number of efficient methods for operating on
    the delayed matrix of residuals, most notably matrix multiplication 
    and calculation of row/column sums or means.
