Description: 
    Provides delayed computation of a matrix of residuals after fitting a
    linear model to each column of an input matrix. The only requirement is
    that the input matrix has a suitably efficient set of matrix multiplication
    operators. Supports partial computation of residuals where selected
    factors are to be preserved in the output matrix.
